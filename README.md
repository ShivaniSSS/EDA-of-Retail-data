# EDA-of-Retail-data
In this project, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is performed on Retail data of a sample superstore for powerful insights. 

Power BI has been used to create the report and dashboard. It is a business analytics tool by Microsoft.

Also, a notebook has been attached involving step by step EDA.

For preview, a pdf file is attached, but to get the interactive dashboard, download the .pbix file and open in Power BI desktop/service along with the data.
